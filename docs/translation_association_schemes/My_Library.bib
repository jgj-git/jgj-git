We give a geometric interpretation of the results of Sheekey (Adv Math Commun 10:475–488, 2016, Sect. 5) on linear sets on a projective line. We extend this to linear sets in arbitrary dimension, giving the connection between two constructions for linear sets defined in Lunardon (J Comb Theory Ser A 149:1–20, 2017). Finally, we then exploit this connection by using the {MacWilliams} identities to obtain information about the possible weight distribution of a linear set of rank n on a projective line \$\${\textbackslash}mathrm \{{PG}\}(1,q{\textasciicircum}n)\$\$.},

The authors begin by discussing well-known proofs of the {EKR} bound for intersecting families. The natural generalization of the {EKR} Theorem holds for many different objects that have a notion of intersection, and the bulk of this book focuses on algebraic proofs that can be applied to these different objects. The authors introduce tools commonly used in algebraic graph theory and show how these can be used to prove versions of the {EKR} Theorem. Topics include association schemes, strongly regular graphs, the Johnson scheme, the Hamming scheme and the Grassmann scheme. Readers can expand their understanding at every step with the 170 end-of-chapter exercises. The final chapter discusses in detail 15 open problems, each of which would make an interesting research project.},

Many examples of these, including Hamming scheme and sesquilinear forms schemes, are provided. This con- struction is further generalized to show the duality of the association schemes coming from actions of two finite groups on the same finite abelian group. An example of this is supplied with weak Hamming schemes.},

	abstract = {This paper contains a survey of association scheme theory (with its algebraic and analytical aspects) and of its applications to coding theory (in a wide sense). It is mainly concerned with a class of subjects that involve the central notion of the distance distribution of a code. Special emphasis is put on the linear programming method, inspired by the {MacWilliams} transform. This produces upper bounds for the size of a code with a given minimum distance, and lower bounds for the size of a design with a given strength. The most specific results are obtained in the case where the underlying association scheme satisfies certain well-defined "polynomial properties;" this leads one into the realm of orthogonal polynomial theory. In particular, some "universal bounds" are derived for codes and designs in polynomial type association schemes. Throughout the paper, the main concepts, methods, and results are illustrated by two examples that are of major significance in classical coding theory, namely, the Hamming scheme and the Johnson scheme. Other topics that receive special attention are spherical codes and designs, and additive codes in translation schemes, including Z/sub 4/-additive binary codes.},

It has thus become essential for workers in many scientific fields to have some familiarity with the subject. The authors have tried to be as comprehensive as possible, dealing in a unified manner with, for example, graph theory, extremal problems, designs, colorings and codes. The depth and breadth of the coverage make the book a unique guide to the whole of the subject.

The main emphasis is put on subsets of Ω and their q-distance structure. Certain q-ary codes are attached to a given X ⊂ Ω; the Hamming distance enumerators of these codes depend only on the q-distance enumerator of X. Interesting examples are provided by Singleton systems X ⊂ Ω, which are defined as t-designs of index 1 in a suitable semilattice (for a given integer t).

	abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as {PCM} and {PPM} which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist1 and Hartley2 on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information.},

It included a list of 73 unsolved problems of which about 20 have been completely solved in the intervening period and about 10 more have been partially solved. The present work comprises six contributed chapters and also six further chapters written by the editors themselves. As well as discussing the advances which have been made in the subject matter of most of the chapters of the earlier book, this new book contains one chapter which deals with a subject (r-orthogonal latin squares) which did not exist when the earlier book was written.The success of the former book is shown by the two or three hundred published papers which deal with questions raised by it.},

	abstract = {Let U be a (k−12−1)-dimensional subspace of quadratic forms defined on Fk with the property that U does not contain any reducible quadratic form. Let V(U) be the points of {PG}(k−1,F) which are zeros of all quadratic forms in U. We will prove that if there is a group G which fixes U and no line of {PG}(k−1,F) and V(U) spans {PG}(k−1,F) then any hyperplane of {PG}(k−1,F) is incident with at most k points of V(U). If F is a finite field then the linear code generated by the matrix whose columns are the points of V(U) is a k-dimensional linear code of length {\textbar}V(U){\textbar} and minimum distance at least {\textbar}V(U){\textbar}−k. A linear code with these parameters is an {MDS} code or an almost {MDS} code. We will construct examples of such subspaces U and groups G, which include the normal rational curve, the elliptic curve, Glynn’s arc from Glynn (1986) and other examples found by computer search. We conjecture that the projection of V(U) from any k−4 points is contained in the intersection of two quadrics, the common zeros of two linearly independent quadratic forms. This would be a strengthening of a classical theorem of Fano, which itself is an extension of a theorem of Castelnuovo, for which we include a proof using only linear algebra.},

This number is well-known since the paper of Carlitz and Hodges (Duke Math. J. 22 (1995) 393), but with a more restrictive definition of hermitian matrices and with a rather different proof. Next, we introduce a linear code Γ(N,t,s) on Fs constructed with the same method as Reed–Muller one, and compute its weight distribution. Γ(N,t,s) is a generalization of the two codes Γ and C studied in Mercier (J. Pure Appl. Algebra 173 (3) (2003) 273) and the method for obtaining its weight distribution is new and more straightforward. Tools are exponential sums and linear algebra on Ft.},

Coverage includes a detailed treatment of the forbidden subgraph problem from a geometrical point of view, and a chapter on maximum distance separable codes, which includes a proof that such codes over prime fields are short. The author also provides more than 100 exercises (complete with detailed solutions), which show the diversity of applications of finite fields and their geometries. Finite Geometry and Combinatorial Applications is ideal for anyone, from a third-year undergraduate to a researcher, who wishes to familiarise themselves with and gain an appreciation of finite geometry.},
