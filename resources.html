        <p>I did my bachelor's thesis on rank-metric and additive Hamming codes.
                Tranlation association schemes arise from rank-metric codes, and
                the study of the former can give us a lot of useful information
                on the latter. Since there is not much content available on
                translation association schemes out there and it is often not
                taught on university, I had to go through a lot of dense books
                to get familiar with this objects. Here is a
                short but detailed introduction to translation association
                schemes that I extracted from my thesis:</p>
